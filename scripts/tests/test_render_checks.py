"""THE RENDER-CHECK HARNESS: one constructed red/green pair per check the chart declares.

COPIED FROM `yadgarhq/iam-db`'s `scripts/tests/test_render_checks.py` AT
`origin/main`, NOT RE-DERIVED (ADR-0679), which took it in turn from
`yadgarhq/platform`. That file is the worked reference for this construction; a
matcher a sibling has hardened is copied, because the measurements below took three
rounds to get right and a second derivation gets them wrong in a new way. What
changes here is named at the bottom of this docstring and nowhere else.

WHAT A RENDER CHECK IS FOR. A toggle GATES a resource — it says "render a
ScaledObject". It does not DIAGNOSE a missing prerequisite: a toggle set true on a
cluster with no KEDA renders cleanly and then fails at apply with `no matches for
kind ScaledObject`, half-way through an install, naming a kind rather than an
operator somebody has to install. `templates/render-checks.yaml` turns that into a
render-time refusal that names the operator, the API group and the toggle that asked
for it.

THE TRAP, MEASURED ON helm 3.18.4 AND 4.3.0 AND NOT NEGOTIABLE, AND IT DECIDES HOW
BOTH CASES BELOW ARE CONSTRUCTED. A plain `helm template` with NO `--api-versions`
does not populate `.Capabilities.APIVersions` with CRD-backed groups at all — it
carries helm's built-in Kubernetes groups and nothing else — so
`.Capabilities.APIVersions.Has "keda.sh/v1alpha1"` answers FALSE whatever the
cluster holds, and the check refuses for the RENDERER'S reason rather than for the
target's. A red case built that way cannot tell "the check works" apart from "the
renderer always answers false", which makes it no evidence at all.

SO BOTH CASES PASS `--api-versions`, AND THEY DIFFER ONLY IN WHAT IS IN IT.
Measured at the same time: `--api-versions` ADDS to helm's built-in set rather
than replacing it. THAT IS WHY THE FILLER MUST NOT BE BUILT IN: a built-in group
passed through `--api-versions` leaves `.Has` unchanged for every group, so the
render would be indistinguishable from a bare one and the red case would prove
nothing. Say `.Has` and not "changes nothing observable", because the LENGTH does
move — measured, a built-in group passed through `--api-versions` is APPENDED as a
duplicate, so `len .Capabilities.APIVersions` grows by one while `.Has` answers the
same for every group. A tripwire written on the length therefore reports a built-in
group as not built in, inverting the check it exists to protect.
`assert_the_red_group_is_not_built_in` below reads `.Has` and never the length.

THE CONSTRUCTION IS STATED OVER ALL THE CHECKS THE RENDER EXERCISES, NEVER OVER ONE
ALONE, because `fail` aborts the WHOLE chart render at the FIRST failing check and
the refusal names only that check. A red case that leaves a SECOND check unsatisfied
refuses for THAT check's reason rather than for the reason of the check under test —
the same defect one level up from the bare render refusing for the renderer's reason.
So, for a render exercising a set of checks:

  GREEN          `--api-versions` for EVERY group the render's checks ask for. It
                 must succeed and render objects.
  RED, check i   every one of those groups EXCEPT i's, PLUS the filler. It must
                 refuse, and the refusal must name check i's operator. That last
                 clause is what makes the refusal ATTRIBUTABLE to the check under
                 test, and it is the assertion a builder who meets a red suite while
                 adding a check is most tempted to delete. Deleting it is the
                 disarmament this harness exists to prevent.

THE FILLER STAYS IN THE RED CASE AT EVERY COUNT, THE ONE-CHECK CHART INCLUDED — and
THIS chart is the one-check case, so the clause is load-bearing here rather than
hypothetical. With one check "every group except i's" is empty, so dropping the
filler collapses the red case back into the bare render this docstring forbids. At
one check the construction reduces to the filler alone; at two or more it does not.

THE FILLER CARRIES A TRIPWIRE ASSERTING TWO THINGS, and both run BEFORE any red case.
First, that the filler is absent from a BARE render's `.Capabilities.APIVersions`
(`assert_the_red_group_is_not_built_in`). Second, that the filler is not one of the
groups the chart's own checks ask for (`assert_the_filler_is_not_a_declared_group`) —
an obligation the generalised red case creates. A colliding filler does not pass
silently: measured, the red case for the group it collides with SUCCEEDS and renders
every object. But what goes red is that check's own red case, reported as "this red
case did not refuse", which names a symptom rather than the cause. The second
assertion names the cause, which is why it runs first.

IT ASSERTS HOW MANY PAIRS IT EXERCISED, against a number written here. The rule the
number is computed from is ONE PAIR PER RENDER CHECK THE CHART DECLARES — not per
CRD-backed kind, and not per API GROUP either, because one toggle can render several
kinds, from more than one group, behind ONE check. `templates/render-checks.yaml` is
where each check states what it guards, and the count of checks is never to be read
off the count of kinds rendered. `EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` below is the one place the
number lives. Printing a count is not asserting one, and the difference is the whole
point: a harness that quietly exercises one fewer check after somebody deletes one is
the "passes having examined nothing" failure wearing a green tick.

AND THE CONSTRUCTION IS PROVED AT A COUNT THIS CHART DOES NOT CONTROL.
`test_the_construction_is_correct_at_two_checks` builds a throwaway TWO-check chart
around THIS chart's own `_require_api.tpl` and runs the SAME construction over it.
The fixture's count is `FIXTURE_RENDER_CHECKS`, which is two whatever
`EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` happens to say — so the generalisation stays proved at two
on a chart declaring one, and stays proved on the next chart this file is copied into
whatever that one declares. THIS PARAGRAPH IS DELIBERATELY WRITTEN OVER NO PARTICULAR
COUNT: this file is copied into every chart that carries a render check, and a reason
stated in terms of one chart's count arrives false in the next.

WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE `iam-db` REFERENCE, so a reader diffing the two meets the
list rather than reconstructing it:

  - the template name is `gateway.require-api`, not `iam-db.require-api` and not
    `platform.require-api`. Helm template names are GLOBAL across a chart tree, and
    the parent renders every module chart in ONE namespace — one name shared between
    every chart that copies this partial is a collision that is invisible in each of
    them alone. LEDGER TASK 1063 carries the measurement and the obligation on the
    parent's suite, which is the only place distinctness can be asserted. `CHART`
    below is the one place the name is written, and the `INVOCATION` regex and the
    two-check fixture are both built from it.
  - the check is KEDA's rather than mariadb-operator's, behind `autoscaling.enabled`
    rather than `database.create`. This chart declares ONE check, so
    `EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` is 1.
  - NO GATEWAY API CHECK IS DECLARED, and the absence is a decision. A render check
    may only ever sit behind a default-false toggle; `gateway.enabled` is the one
    toggle in this estate that is true by default, so a check behind it would refuse
    every offline render in the estate. The rule is about the toggle's DEFAULT, not
    about the API group.
  - `test_the_checks_are_unreachable_at_the_chart_defaults` cannot assert the
    defaults render NOTHING, because this chart's defaults render a ConfigMap, a Deployment, an HTTPRoute,
    a PodDisruptionBudget, a Service and a ServiceAccount. It asserts instead that
    they render no object of the checked group, and `test_autoscaling.py` carries the
    count those objects are asserted against.

    `exercise_one_pair_per_declared_check` had none, and at ONE check — which is this
    chart — they are what tells a red case apart from a bare render BY NAME: a bare
    render still exits non-zero and still names the one operator there is. So a builder
    who meets a red suite while adding a second check and does exactly what the
    docstrings above warn against — deletes `+ FILLER_API_VERSIONS` from

    `len(declared)` is one, so it fails `0 == 1` on the chart itself — not on a
    fixture. The suite goes fully green only when that assertion is deleted too. A
    sentence calling these two tripwires the only witness would be false, and was.

    IT IS NOT THE BUILDER COMPARED WITH ITSELF, which is the objection those
    tripwires' own comment raises against `set(red_api_versions(...)) <= set(red.args)`.
    The INPUT here is hand-written and the EXPECTED VALUE is the module-level literal
    — neither is produced by the function under test. What it asserts is the reduction
    the module docstring states: at one check "every declared group except the one

    toggle in this estate, and the HTTPRoute it renders is what a one-entry exemption
    exists for. The rule is about the toggle's DEFAULT, not about the API group.
